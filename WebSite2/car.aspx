        third generation Swift is being produced at Suzuki&#39;s plant in Hungary from where 
        it will be supplied across Europe. The new car has its wheelbase extended by 50 
        millimeters over the previous second generation and has many visual updates. 
        While the new car looks different from the old one, its design is an evolution 
        of the radical second generation styling with a longer and more rounded 
        appearance. Post-September 2010 Swifts are fitted with a heavily revised version 
        of the K12 engine found in the Suzuki Wagon R+d. During September 2010, Suzuki 
        in the United Kingdom released the third generation Swift onto British roads.</span></p>

        VVT petrol engine (K14B) which produces 95 hp.</span></p>

        platform. It features three rows of seats and is available in rear-wheel drive
