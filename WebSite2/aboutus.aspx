    With cars in India multiplying by the day, the costs of owning one have gone 
    beyond just the initial financials! Periodic depreciation in value, high 
    maintenance costs, rising fuel prices, parking space shortages in cities, etc. 
    add a hefty premium to the overall cost of ownership. Vroom’s vehicles offer you 
    with a ‘self-drive car rental’ solution- one in which you’re in the driving 
    seat, literally.</span></p>
