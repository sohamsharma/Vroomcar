In today’s world of hyper-competition and ever decreasing product life cycles, innovation is not only key to business growth, it is absolutely essential for survival. This is especially true for the travel and transportation industry, which has historically been slow to innovate. One reason is that most of these companies, particularly those in the car rental space, still rely on the traditional ethos of customer service and employee loyalty to drive business value, rather than exploring technological transformation designed around customer centricity. They have not fully inculcated disruptive digital technologies and techniques to sharpen their customer focus within their business mechanisms. Today, rental cars are on the verge of becoming commodities; in a traveler's survey conducted by Google, only 48% of leisure travellers saw a clear difference between car rental brands. The core competencies that once gave key players an edge — providing new, clean and reliable cars — are no longer sufficient. The ongoing digital revolution has allowed consumers to share more information about themselves — opening new channels through which car rental companies can approach them. At the same time, customers expect this data to be used to provide them with secure, more personalized experiences and effortless access to service. Meeting these expectations requires a new mindset — rethinking products and processes, and closely studying and adopting the best practices of other industries and business sectors.

•	Travelling by car can get you places which can be very difficult to reach by public transport or tour. It gives you the convenience of going your own way, in your own time, and it can often be cheaper than public transport alternatives, especially if travelling as a couple or a group.
•	Major global car rental companies have famous brands that operate in many countries throughout the world, for example Avis, Hertz, etc. Sometimes the regional operator can be an independent company using the name under licence, and often the local operator is just a franchisee. 
•	Some rental agreements may have a limit on how far you can travel per day or in total, and will charge for additional distance traveled. Others have unlimited mileage.	
•	 Rental car agencies invariably require a mechanism to have a security deposit in case of damage, fines or even failure to return a car.
•	Rental cars can be booked as per the requirements of the customer for hours, days or weeks.


The existing system is well-maintained and is very useful for the user, but there are some limitations which I am going to discuss below:-

•	In the existing system of Car Rental, When renting with a major rental car agency at most locations, a reservation doesn't guarantee your rental. On their side, the rental car agencies overbook.
•	 If you don't book you run a greater risk of no availability,  particularly in a small location, or at popular times of year.
•	 It is mandatory to be physically present at the rental office.
•	Sometimes the person is required to pay all the charges by cash only.


Some of the changes that I am going to made in the project that is other than the existing project:-
•	A signup page for registration is provided to the users in which they can login & send the data and answer the queries as per admin’s requirement.
•	Cost effective – The costs of traveling and associated paper work are considerably reduced. Telephonic assisance is provided along with doorstep delivery.
•	A separate log is created for each and every booking that is made for the admin to review later.
•	The admin also gets to update the car listing remotely as per the new availability.
